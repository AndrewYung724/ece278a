# Instructions for HW-1
 
You may choose either of the approaches to get started with the homework. Feel free to ask additional questions on Slack - `#technical-help`
 
 
## Approach 1
*Suggested for those who are new to programming*
 
**Steps**
1. Open the notebook by clicking on the button below. This directly opens the notebook in your browser without any additional steps, yes that easy !
 
  [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/bioshape-lab/ece3/blob/main/hw/ECE3_HW1.ipynb)
 
2. You can get started right away by executing each of the cells (Shift + Enter). Note that you will be required to login. The best thing is every required package is *pre-installed* on colab. Any additional packages should be installed as you execute the cells with minimal issues.

3. Once you click File > Save, it asks to save a copy in Drive. **Make sure to do it**
4. Continue working on your HW. Follow the demonstration below if you are unsure how to submit !

> As it might be obvious by now, an active internet connection is required at all times for this approach. Otherwise you might have to switch to Approach 2.
 
 
## Approach 2
*Recommended if you are familiar with installing new packages using `pip`*
 
You can continue working with your Jupyter notebook locally. Once done, upload your notebook file to GauchoSpace. (`.ipynb` format upload only).
